Hi, I am Ansh Sharma!  
Known as Cdansh13 on my gihub account. I am just of 11 years, but still love to code beautiful Websites and Softwares. I started my coding journey when i was just of 10 years!  
Coding is my passion and I love to do coding. Just a few weeks ago i got to know about github pages. I created my github account around 2021. And was suprised after watching the easy  hosting of websites on github!  
Firstly, I started learning HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language), But had never heard about css and javascript! And I now a days coding most of websites in javascript which can become helpful and i amd posting them on my github account as well as on github pages!
After having a little bit knowledge about HTML i heard about Python and started learning it. But i enjoyed more in coding while developing websites. So, i started giving most of my time to web development!
And soon the day came when i coded my first website in django! But believe me, the start was very frustrating. It took me around 30 mins to just code a Hello World website!
But sooner or later i became successful in django as well as in HTML,CSS and JavaScript!  
We should never give up!
Thanks!
